Nintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen, where the owner can: play with, train, pet, walk, brush and wash a virtual dog. The game also utilizes the built-in microphone, where the player can call their puppy or teach the puppy tricks. Money can be earned by placing in competitions or selling items at the secondhand shop and can be used to purchase supplies, puppies and home decor. Dogs can be walked and can be taken to the park where they can practice disc catching skills for disc competitions and to the gymnasium to practice dog agility for agility trials. While walking, question mark icons on the map point out areas that may contain neighborhood dogs or presents, though presents can be found unmarked as well and collected by speaking into the microphone, sending information to the DS.

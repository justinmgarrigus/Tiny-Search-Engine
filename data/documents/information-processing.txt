Information can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. Bits of information can be streamed via signals. Audio can be gained from a microphone. Its processing is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier - whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in information theory, telecommunications, information engineering and has applications in medical image computing and speech synthesis, among others.
